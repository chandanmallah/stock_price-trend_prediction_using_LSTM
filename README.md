# stock_price-trend_prediction_using_LSTM

Long short term memory (LSTM) is a model that increases the memory of recurrent neural networks.

Dataset : pandas.datareader is used for fetching live data from Yahoofinance
we explored LSTM and stock price using LSTM. 
We then visualized the opening and closing price value after using LSTM.
100 days and 200 days MA(moving Average is used for stock trend prediction)
